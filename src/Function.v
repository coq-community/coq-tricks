(** Now we'll redo the above using the standard library's [Fix] combinator,
which provides general well-founded recursion.

 See CPDT's chapter http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/GeneralRec.html for an
 excellent overview, including a better description of how this approach itself
 works under the hood. *)

     : forall (A : Type) (R : A -> A -> Prop),
       well_founded R ->
       forall P : A -> Type,
       (forall x : A, (forall y : A, R y x -> P y) -> P x) ->
       forall x : A, P x

To read this, start at the bottom: we're writing a function of type [forall (x:A), P
x]. The recursion is over [A] and decreases the relation [R], which must be
well-founded (think of [A = nat] and [R = lt] as examples). The body of the
function has the type

[forall (x:A) (F: forall (y:A), R y x -> P y), P x]

[x] is simply the argument to the body. The second argument is what I've called
[F] here: think of this as being the function being defined itself, in order to
support recursion. The catch is in its signature: instead of just taking [y:A],
it also takes [R y x]; that is, in order to call [F] recursively, you must pass
a proof that the argument used is smaller than the outer argument [x]. Because
[R] is well-founded, eventually this body must stop calling itself recursively.

(* We need to provide a wrapper around the standard library's [Fix_eq], which
describes the computational behavior of a [Fix] as being the same as a one-step
unfolding. However, the theorem also requires one to prove the body is unable to
distinguish between [F] arguments that are extensionally equal; this is true of
any Gallina code but can't be proven within Coq once and for all. *)
